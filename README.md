# Lending Club Case Study

> The loan dataset provides details about previous loan applicants, including their repayment behavior ('defaulted' or not). The objective is to uncover patterns that predict the likelihood of default. This analysis can inform decisions such as rejecting loans, adjusting loan amounts, or offering loans with higher interest rates to higher-risk applicants.

## Process
- Data Collection: We imported the loan dataset provided by upgrad
- Data understand: We referenced the data dictionary to comprehend the variables in the dataset. 
- Data Cleaning : We addressed missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data
- Feature Engineering : We transformed variables into more relevant forms to enhance their usefulness in our analysis.
- EDA :We visualized and analyzed the data to uncover relationships, trends, and potential biases.
        - Conducted Univariate Analysis to understand individual variable distributions.
        - Performed Bivariate Analysis to explore relationships between variables.
- Results: We identified key variables associated with loan defaulters or charged-off clients.




## Conclusions
- Around 3.5% of the loan offered becomes bad loan
- Around 15% loans fall into medium to high-risk zone
